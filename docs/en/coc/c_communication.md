# Communication

## Respect the Speaker During Presentations

- Please do not engage in disruptive behavior or make noise that could disturb the speaker or the audience during the presentation.
- Avoid interrupting the presentation until the speaker explicitly signals that they are open to questions. Please follow the designated time and method for asking questions.

## Conversations Are a Shared Experience

- Many people participate in discussions in various places, such as open spaces, the PyCon Korea Slack, and YouTube channels. People from diverse backgrounds and with different levels of knowledge may join these discussions. Differences in opinion are natural, and remember that others' opinions are just as valuable as your own.
- Refrain from interrupting or talking over others, and avoid raising your voice. Constructive criticism is welcome, but do not engage in personal attacks or hurtful criticism aimed at bringing others down.

## Use Polite Expressions

- "That language/library/OS is garbage" ❌
- "I think that language/library/OS has certain shortcomings" ⭕
- Criticize the content, not the person.
  - "People who believe in theory X are idiots" ❌
  - "Theory X lacks sufficient evidence" ⭕
- Focus on providing alternatives rather than just pointing out flaws.
- Do not hurt others just to showcase your knowledge.
- Ensure that all participants have an equal opportunity to engage in the conversation.
- Even if conflicts arise, maintain a respectful and polite attitude.

## Avoid One-Sided Propaganda or Agitation

- Personal beliefs and political inclinations should be respected. However, do not interfere with other participants' ability to engage in the event, and avoid unsolicited propaganda or agitation that is out of context.
  - Including political slogans or excessive promotional material in presentation slides
  - Chanting slogans in groups in front of booths
  - Repeatedly promoting opinions in the comments on PyCon Korea’s official SNS, Slack, or YouTube channels to the extent that it prevents others from sharing their views
