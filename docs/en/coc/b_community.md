# Community

## Create a Welcoming Atmosphere

All participants, regardless of their background, should feel welcomed. If someone feels unwelcome or isolated, they may hesitate to engage with the community. Help foster a welcoming environment to ensure the Python community can continue to grow.

- Be kind and warm to beginners or those attending for the first time.
- Be courageous. If you feel more comfortable listening or observing, that's perfectly fine. If you hesitate to join a conversation, remember that the people actively talking might have just met for the first time today.
- Respond. The other person may have gathered the courage to say something to you. Kindly answer questions or requests for help, and express gratitude for the answers you receive.

## Ensure PyCon Korea is Safe

Always take responsibility for your words and actions. PyCon Korea is an event with diverse participants. To ensure that everyone feels safe and secure in the community, avoid any behavior or speech that could threaten or endanger others.

- Be mindful not to engage in unnecessary physical contact with others.
  - Examples: Holding someone's hand or putting your arm around them without consent
- Avoid using profanity/slang/vulgar language in conversations. Even with close acquaintances, it can make others uncomfortable or feel threatened.
- Do not threaten others with angry outbursts, aggressive gestures, or by raising your voice.
- Avoid any language, behavior, or objectification that could make someone feel uncomfortable.
  - Example: "It felt so dreary with just a bunch of guys, but now that there are women, it feels like a garden!"
  - Example: Using slang like "Aang, g**chi" as an exclamation
- Do not touch other people's belongings without permission.
  - Example: Cell phones, laptops, etc.
  - Example: [Assistive devices](http://knat.go.kr/knw/home/knat_DB/my.html) (hearing aids, wheelchairs, etc.)
- Do not carry dangerous items.
  - Example: Baseball bats, chemical substances, firearms, sharp objects, etc.
- Do not engage in any violent behavior that violates the law.
- Do not encourage or incite any of the above behaviors.

## Respect Differences

Create an event where everyone can participate regardless of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, nationality, race, region, religion, age, social status, education, knowledge level, appearance, disability, illness, or food preferences.

- Avoid gender-stereotyped language and behavior.
  - Example: "That's just how men/women are."
  - Example: Assuming a female developer is a front-end developer by saying, "You're a front-end developer, right?"
- Do not use sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression as a subject of jokes or derogatory comments.
  - Example: "Are you gay?", "With hair that short, you look like a lesbian."
- Do not discriminate based on age, social status, or years of experience.
  - Example: Speaking informally to someone you've just met just because they are younger
  - Example: "You probably don't know this since you don't have many years of experience, but..."
- Do not make assumptions about topics that may vary based on income or wealth.
- Avoid using racial or regional slurs or expressions based on nationality.
  - Example: Using slurs based on nationality such as "J***," "C***," or similar
  - Example: Using slurs based on race such as "Yankee," "banana," or "black dude"
  - Example: Regional slurs like "J**ba," etc.
- Do not insult others' religions or political beliefs, and do not force your own beliefs onto others.
  - Example: "People who follow [Religion] are a problem."
  - Example: "People who support [Political Party] are a problem."
- Refrain from making unnecessary judgments or discriminatory comments about someone's appearance.
  - Example: "You look like a developer" or "You don't look like a developer."
  - Example: Referring to someone based on appearance, like "the pretty female developer."
- Do not treat people with disabilities as individuals in need of help based on stereotypes or assumptions.
  - Acting in a way you think is helpful without being asked can be disruptive. Check with the person and provide assistance in the way they prefer.
- Do not make derogatory remarks about illnesses or disabilities.
  - Avoid using offensive terms for disabilities.
    - Example: Terms like "blind," "one-eyed," "deaf," "mute," "cripple," etc.
    - Example: "Are you disabled?" or "Do you seem mentally ill?"
  - Example: "This legacy code is going to give me cancer."
- Do not make comments that force or disregard other people's dietary choices.
  - Example: "If you don't drink, what joy is left in life?"
  - Example: "For the sake of your health, you should eat meat."
  - You don't need a reason that others find acceptable for your dietary preferences. Do not ask for or force explanations from others.
- Do not make discriminatory remarks based on education or major.
  - Example: "Did you only graduate high school?"
  - Example: "As a non-major, you probably don't know about this."
- Do not encourage or incite any of the above biases or discrimination.

Regardless of your intention, the other person may feel uncomfortable. If someone expresses discomfort, immediately stop the behavior and apologize.

## Do Not Impersonate PyCon Korea Staff or Spread False Information

Impersonating staff can confuse participants with incorrect information and may prevent those who need help from receiving timely assistance. The PyCon Korea Organizing Committee does not disclose or distribute information outside of official channels to avoid any disadvantages caused by information gaps between participants.

- Do not deliberately act in a way that may lead to confusion with event staff (e.g., using profile pictures or nicknames similar to staff members). If such behavior is deemed disruptive, actions such as profile change requests may be taken.
- Do not spread unofficial information (e.g., rumors, hearsay) outside of official sources (such as the website, announcements, official SNS, or emails sent by PyCon Korea).
  - Example: "My friend/acquaintance is on the PyCon Korea organizing committee, and they told me thatâ€¦"
