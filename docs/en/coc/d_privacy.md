# Privacy

## Be Cautious When Taking Photos and Videos

- Always respect the consent of the people being photographed or filmed. Some may not want to be in photos or videos.
- PyCon Korea will provide methods for those who do not wish to be photographed or filmed during any official event organized by the PyCon Korea committee. Specific ways to express this preference will be announced for each event.
- For online events, the following applies:
  - Do not capture screenshots of presentation videos and share them without proper attribution.

## Protect Personal Information

- Do not include information in your presentation that can identify someone without their consent.
- Do not capture or share private information such as conversation messages or profiles without the consent of the individuals involved.
- If someone does not wish to answer a question, please do not ask again. Respect others' decisions.
- Even if some information seems trivial to you, it may not be the same for others. Certain questions can be highly inappropriate by themselves.
  - Examples: "How old are you?"
  - "Are you married?" "Do you have children?" "Do you have a partner?"
  - "What kind of medication are you taking?"
  - "How did you become disabled?"
