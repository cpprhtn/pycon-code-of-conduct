## How to Report

If you encounter any problems, see someone else in trouble, or have any discomfort, please seek help from the PyCon Korea organizing committee (hereinafter referred to as "the committee"). In emergency situations, please report to both the committee and the relevant authorities, such as the police or fire department.

- The committee is trained on how to respond to violations of the code of conduct.
- In offline spaces, committee members will wear visible shirts to identify themselves. In online spaces, you can contact them via the email provided above.

Upon receiving a report of a code of conduct violation, the PyCon Korea organizing committee will promptly protect the participant according to the incident handling procedures and take steps to stop the violation. If necessary, actions such as expulsion from the event or contacting law enforcement or medical authorities may be taken. Efforts will be made to protect the identity of the reporter or victim during this process.

If you suspect a code of conduct violation but are not sure, please inform the committee. They will gather more information and decide whether or not to take action.

Your courage helps create a safer community.

## Limitations of the Code of Conduct

Despite various efforts to maintain a safe and pleasant community, the code of conduct cannot fully protect participants from all threats. In emergency situations, please seek help from staff and report to the appropriate authorities, such as the police or fire department.

If it is difficult to verify the facts, it can be challenging to take action against the reported person or group based solely on suspicion. Regardless of whether action is taken, if you feel threatened, assistance such as accompaniment can be provided.
